				<h1>Visualizing Networks in Boston Data</h1>

			<p>
				Networks and connections are everywhere. In the data provided by the city of Boston
				and its partners, we explored some of the networks in the data to identify patterns
				of mobility and social interactions. Our goal was to create some basic interactive
				visualizations of these networks by incorporating different data sets, using the foundations
				of graph theory, to provide new insights.
			<p>
			<p>
				The connection of ideas is important for a truly innovative city. One of the primary
				means of idea flow is an effective and resilient transportation network.
				Our project started with an exploration of the bus system, and the connections created
				between the towns in the greater Boston area, and within the city's 22 wards. We feel
				these representations augment the view of webmap to show the strength  of the connection between
				the nodes in the system, rather than simply representing them in a physical space.

				Once you have a hammer, you go looking for nails... We wanted to provide an example of this
				method applied, not only to a transportation network, but also to a social network. The data set 
				provided included building permits, including addresses and contractors. We connected contractors 
				by properties that they worked on together to uncover a network of connected contractors that routinely work together.
			<p>
			<p>
				Finally, we wanted to use some of the data provided by the data partners in this hackathon.
				The Run Keeper data fits nicely with our methods. We used the LineStrings in the geojson files
				to build a network of popular Boston neighborhoods to run and bicycle through. The sizes of the nodes
				is scaled by the population in the neighborhood, and color coded by the number of routes originating 
				from that neighborhood, to show which neighborhoods are most utilizing the app. We incorporate the 
				population data to provide a visual of what neighborhoods are not using the app, which leads to a 
				potential marketing opportunity, or could uncover some structural limitations to exercise in particular 
				parts of the city.
